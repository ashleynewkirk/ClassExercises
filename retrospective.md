# Group Assignment Notes - Bookshelf Project

#### __Prompt__ 

Write a short retrospective about what you accomplished during your time working on this project. What you think you did well in and what you could have improved on as well as any other thoughts.

### __My personal contributions__
The majority of my individual contributions were made in CSS. I did contribute small changes to the JavaScript code, but ultimately, not all those changes were included in the final version of the project. I did spend a considerable amount of time trying to write code that displayed exisitng books when the page loads, but couldn't figure out how to incorporate the code correctly with the existing code. I realize that this is a part of the coding process and that I will improve with continued study and practice. 

### __Potential Areas for Improvements__

For this project, there are still some parts of the code that I'm struggling to fully grasp (for example states and the use of  ``` this.state```) I could have done a better of asking for clarification. 

I also feel that I could have been a better advocate for myself and my teammates. One member of our team was very absent from our group due to working with others or simply working alone on our project before clearly defining and delegating the responsibilities and jobs.  Seeking outside help is only problematic when the team isn't included or told what is being done. I don't think this was intentional or done maliciously, but it did lead to some tension in the group. I do feel that I could have done a better job of speaking up to bridge communication gap. 

### __What Went Well__

I feel that I worked very well with the team overall.  I appreciated their contributions and the conversations we had about our project. 

### __Other Thoughts__

This group project was an excellent opportunity for self-reflection on my technical and interpersonal skills. In the future, I hope to help all team members feel included and feel that all of their contributions are significant. I also hope to have a better grasp of the overall code for the project.
